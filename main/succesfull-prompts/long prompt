an example of what i want :

What i give you:

import time

def calculate_factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    factorial_result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        factorial_result *= i
    return factorial_result



What i expect you to return:

import time

def calculate_factorial(n):
    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:  # Adjusted to check for negative integers
        print("Input must be a non-negative integer.")  # Adjusted error message
        return None
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    factorial_result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        factorial_result *= i
    return factorial_result
